					<p>
						When I was in class 5<sup>th</sup> class, My friend
						taught me basic HTML that I fell in love with computers
						kickstarting a neverending quest to learn all the
						technologies and languages in the world which is still
						going on till this day. My journey has since evolved
						into full-stack development, employing frameworks like
						React, Express and NextJS. I love tech and I am always
						curious kind of person. I took a full stack development
						bootcamp course and made projects and portfolio along
						way, I have very wide interest from swimming to DSA and
						DSA to 3D Modeling.
